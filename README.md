# Data-Structures

Linked List
Singly Linked List:
Implements a basic linked list where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. Includes operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

Doubly Linked List:
Extends the singly linked list by adding a pointer to the previous node in each node, enabling bidirectional traversal. Includes operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Circular Linked List:
A linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure. Useful for implementing applications like task scheduling or buffering.

Stack
Stack Using Array:
Implements a stack data structure using a fixed-size array. Includes operations like push, pop, and peek.

Stack Using Linked List:
Implements a dynamic stack using a linked list, allowing stack size to grow or shrink as needed.

Queue
Queue Using Array:
Implements a simple queue using an array. Includes operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

Tree
Binary Tree:
Implements a tree structure where each node has at most two children. Includes operations like insertion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and deletion.
